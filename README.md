# Superstore Sales Performance Analysis

End-to-end data analysis project using **PostgreSQL, Python, and Power BI** to evaluate revenue growth, profitability trends, customer concentration, and the impact of discounting.

This project simulates a real-world junior data analyst workflow:

Raw Data → SQL Validation → Python Analysis → Business Insights → Dashboard Reporting

# SQL Analysis

SQL was used to validate the dataset and answer core business questions through aggregation and grouping.

## 1. What are total sales, total profit, and total quantity sold?

Validated overall business performance and confirmed data integrity after import.

---

## 2. Which Region Performs Best?

Identified the highest revenue-generating customers.

---

# Python Analysis & Visualization

Python was used for trend analysis, growth comparison, margin efficiency, and deeper exploratory insights.

---

## 6. Is the Business Growing Over Time?

![Monthly Sales and Profit Trend](screenshots/image1.png)

Sales show a consistent upward trend across years. Profit generally follows revenue growth, though with higher volatility.

---

## 7. Is Profit Growing at the Same Rate as Sales?

![Sales vs Profit Growth](screenshots/image2.png)

Profit growth broadly aligns with sales growth, though certain periods show margin compression.

---

## 8. Which Categories Are Most Efficient?

![Profit Margin by Category](screenshots/image5.png)

Technology demonstrates the strongest profitability efficiency relative to revenue.

---

## 9. Does Discounting Hurt Profit?

![Discount vs Profit](screenshots/image3.png)

Higher discount levels are associated with declining profit and increased likelihood of losses.

---

## 10. Is Revenue Concentrated Among Few Customers?

![Customer Revenue Concentration](screenshots/image4.png)

Revenue is partially concentrated among a small group of high-value customers.

# Power BI Dashboard

An interactive dashboard was developed in Power BI to present executive-level insights.

The dashboard includes:

- Total Sales, Profit, and Profit Margin KPIs
    
- Monthly Revenue & Profit Trends
    
- Sales by Region
    
- Profit by Category
    
- Discount Impact Analysis
    
- Top Customer Breakdown
    

[Insert Image – Power BI Dashboard Overview]

The dashboard enables interactive filtering by region, category, and time period.
